                <h3>Why I want to do Cyber Security</h3>
            </div>
            
            <p>I am interested in learning Cyber Security because I like the idea of how the industry is constantly in competiton between people trying to secure systems and people trying to exploit them. I hope that this competitiveness within the industry will help to keep my career interesting and motivate me to work harder at it.
            <br><br>
            Originally when I came to University in my foundation year I planned to do normal computer science but after speaking to people who does Cyber in their second year, I found that the topics they where covering I found very interesting. Ontop of this, during my foundation year, someone hacked my spotify and other accounts through one of my old email addresses. This motivated me to learn more about internet and software security to help ensure that I would not be hacked again.</p>

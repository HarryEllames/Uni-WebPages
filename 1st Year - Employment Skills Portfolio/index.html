                I am a first year cyber security student at Staffordshire University. I chose to study this subject at university because it has excellent student reviews and supportive campus staff.

                <p>
                    Staffordshire university also specialises Computers along side Psychology (SI-UK, 2020). Because of this I made the assumption that the university would have high standard labs for my course and great lecturers with the ability to help me get the most out of my course.

                    <h4>American Football</h4>
                    <p>I play american football for my university team: 'The Staffordshire Stallions'. I played for the first time when I joined university in september 2018. Since playing I have learnt alot more about the sport and developed many transferable skills within it.

                <h4>Health and Fitness</h4>
                <p>
                    I am also interested in health and fitness. I attend the gym as often as I can, ranging from 3 times a week up to 6 times on a week. I also try to maintain a healthy diet and make sure I consume enough nutrients throughout the day.
                    <br>
                    I first started to get into fitness at 15 when I was allowed to start weight training. Despite being too young to join a gym, I managed to find some free weights I could use. Later when I was old enough to join a gym I started going every day after college with one of my friends. After a while I started to have to go on my own as he dislocated his shoulder.
